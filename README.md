I am Prime-Lasking, a self-taught programmer.
Projects:
- Assemplex: A self made programming language made to be a go-based simple programming language with good performance {currently unmaintained)
- Todoit: A CLI-based todo application made for privacy where all of your todo lists are on your device.
- NeoAnki: A terminal based Anki clone
- Okfish: A lichess bot that is Ok.. at chess.
- Z: My favourite project yet, a programming language written in python which is very simple but is blazingly fast due to its compilation to machine code  through c and gcc.
